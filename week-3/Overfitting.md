# The problem of Overfitting

### Underfitting Vs Overfitting  

- Underfitting, or high bias, is when the form of our hypothesis function h maps poorly to the trend of the data. It is usually caused by a function that is too simple or uses too few features. <br>
- At the other extreme, overfitting, or high variance, is caused by a hypothesis function that fits the available data but does not generalize well to predict new data. It is usually caused by a complicated function that creates a lot of unnecessary curves and angles unrelated to the data.<br>

### Possible Solutions

There are two main options to address the issue of overfitting:

1) Reduce the number of features:<br>
-   Manually select which features to keep.
-   Use a model selection algorithm (studied later in the course).

2) Regularization<br>
-   Keep all the features, but reduce the magnitude of parameters  θj​.
-   Regularization works well when we have a lot of slightly useful features.
